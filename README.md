Pragmatic Leaders assesment task


Problem statement:
Convert long paragraphs containing long complex sentences into a simple sentence

This model implements GPT-3 to Convert long paragraphs containing long complex sentences into a simple sentence that is easy to read and understand and gives a brief about the whole text paragraph that we input. In this model as an example I have taken an article from 
TOI about Twitter's new feature and the model converts it into and simple sentence. In order to try out other texts you can can paste the text into the variable "text" in th jupyter notebook and check the effeciency and effectiveness of the model.

Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text and this model is aggresively implemented in this solution to the problem assigned to achieve next to perfect results.

I can also implement this model to build a web-application with a basic GUI to make the input and output fluent if required for further assesment.
