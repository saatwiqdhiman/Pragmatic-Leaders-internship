      "Twitter is reportedly working on a new feature for its users called the Twitter Articles. The feature will allow users to create a long-form post within Twitter. The feature is currently under development and was revealed by tipster Jane Manchun Wong via a Twitter post.As of now, not much is known about the upcoming feature. But it is likely that it will allow Twitter users to write article-style posts on Twitter exceeding the current 280 character limit. It is also being said that the feature will not be available for all users. Instead, it will be restricted to select categories of accounts like Super Followers and Twitter Blue subscribers.In case you are unaware, Twitter Blue is a subscription-based service. It is currently not available globally and is limited to countries that include the US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. The subscription costs $2.99, which is roughly Rs 223.With the new Articles feature, Twitter may look to monetize the service by introducing it to select users. A Twitter spokesperson said in a CNET report that it will reveal more details about the new feature soon.\n",
